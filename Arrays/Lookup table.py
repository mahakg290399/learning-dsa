# Given an array of unique integers numbers, your task is to find the number of pairs of indices (i, j) such that i ≤ j and the sum numbers[i] + numbers[j] is equal to some power of 2.

# Note: The numbers 20  = 1, 21 = 2, 22 = 4, 23 = 8, etc. are considered to be powers of 2.

# Example

# For numbers = [1, -1, 2, 3], the output should be solution(numbers) = 5.
# – There is one pair of indices where the sum of the elements is 20 = 1:(1, 2): numbers[1] + numbers[2] = -1 + 2 = 1
# – There are two pairs of indices where the sum of the elements is 21 = 2: (0, 0) and (1, 3)
# – There are two pairs of indices where the sum of the elements is 22 = 4: (0, 3) and (2, 2)
# – In total, there are 1 + 2 + 2 = 5 pairs summing to powers of 2.

# For numbers = [2], the output should be solution(numbers) = 1.
# – The only pair of indices is (0, 0) and the sum is equal to 22 = 4. So, the answer is 1.

# For numbers = [-2, -1, 0, 1, 2], the output should be solution(numbers) = 5.
# – There are two pairs of indices where the sum of the elements is 20 = 1: (2, 3) and (1, 4)
# – There are two pairs of indices where the sum of the elements is 21 = 2: (2, 4) and (3, 3)
# – There is one pair of indices where the sum of the elements is 22 = 4: (4, 4)
# – In total, there are 2 + 2 + 1 = 5 pairs summing to powers of 2. 

# Guaranteed constraints:

# 1 ≤ numbers.length ≤ 105
# -106 ≤ numbers[i] ≤ 106
# This problem could be solved in a straightforward way by having two nested loops to choose each pair and check whether their sum is a power of two. But since the numbers array could be quite large, quadratic time complexity would be too much for this question. (To get more precise, it is O(n2 * log(MAX_NUMBER)) where MAX_NUMBER is the largest number seen in the array.)

# Therefore, this question tests whether candidates have the problem-solving and data structures skills to use a lookup table (hash set/dictionary) in their programming language of choice. It also involves a bit of tricky logic to avoid double-counting pairs. Finally, this question asks candidates to pay close attention to constraints, testing a key skill for real-world development.
